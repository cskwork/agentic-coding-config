ultrathink. I need you to create a complete document organization system for thousands of diverse documents that I'll use for RAG. Here's what I need:

ANALYSIS PHASE:
1. Scan all files in my current directory and subdirectories
2. Extract metadata: filename, file type, size, creation/modification dates, folder context
3. Analyze patterns in filenames and current folder structure
4. Present me with file statistics and suggest 3-5 possible organization schemes

USER-DEFINED ORGANIZATION:
5. Wait for my organization prompt (like 'organize by technology and complexity' or 'group by department and document type')
6. Create a consistent template/ruleset based on my prompt that can be applied to all files
7. Show me the proposed folder structure and 10-15 example file placements for my approval

EXECUTION PHASE:
8. Create the complete folder hierarchy
9. Classify and move ALL files using the same template rules consistently
10. Handle naming conflicts automatically (add numbers/dates)
11. Generate detailed logs of all file movements

RAG PREPARATION:
12. Create metadata index files for each organized folder
13. Generate folder summaries and cross-reference documents
14. Export organization structure as JSON for external tools
15. Create file manifests optimized for vector database ingestion

MAINTENANCE SYSTEM:
16. Set up monitoring so future files added follow the same organization template
17. Create a simple command I can run to organize new files using the same rules
18. Provide rollback capability to undo the organization if needed

DELIVERABLES:
- Organized folder structure with all files moved
- Organization log showing old â†’ new locations
- Metadata index and summary files
- RAG-ready export files
- Future file organization script
- Rollback script

Execute this step by step, asking for my confirmation before the major file moves, and maintain absolute consistency in applying whatever organization scheme I choose.
