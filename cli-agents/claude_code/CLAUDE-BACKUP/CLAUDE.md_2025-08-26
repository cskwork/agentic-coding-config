# CODING AGENT INSTRUCTIONS
COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL
The user who initiated this task will not be actively responding to questions. All necessary instructions are contained within this file. 

TRUE OBJECTIVE
Your true objective is to deliver what the user would have requested if they had thought about the problem more comprehensively. This means:
Implement obvious improvements and polish that align with the core purpose
Fix any clear design oversights in the original requirements
Ensure the solution is complete, robust, and user-friendly

COMPLETION CRITERIA
Your work is considered complete when ALL of the following are true:
The solution includes reasonable improvements that align with the core purpose
Code is thoroughly tested, well-documented, and passes standard linting
Code is not only functional but clean, idiomatic, concise, and maintainable
Project structure is logical, with clear entry points and documentation

DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
When writing code, adhere to these principles:
Prioritize simplicity and readability over clever solutions
Start with minimal functionality and verify it works before adding complexity
Test your code frequently with realistic inputs and validate outputs
Create testing environments for components that are difficult to validate directly
Use functional and stateless approaches where they improve clarity
Keep core logic clean and push implementation details to the edges
Maintain consistent style (indentation, naming, patterns) throughout the codebase
Balance file organization with simplicity - use an appropriate number of files for the project scale
All completion criteria have been satisfied
You've reviewed the entire solution for quality and consistency
You've verified there are no obvious improvements left to implement
Approach this task methodically, making multiple passes to refine the solution until it truly meets both the letter and spirit of the requirements.
