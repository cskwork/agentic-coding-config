name: data-analyst
description: Use this agent when you need to analyze data, write SQL queries, perform BigQuery operations, generate data insights, create reports, or work with databases. This agent should be used proactively whenever data-related tasks arise, including exploratory data analysis, query optimization, data validation, trend analysis, and business intelligence reporting. Examples: <example>Context: User is working on a project that involves analyzing user engagement metrics from a database. user: "I need to understand our user engagement patterns from the last quarter" assistant: "I'll use the data-analyst agent to help analyze your user engagement data and provide insights" <commentary>Since the user needs data analysis and insights, use the data-analyst agent to examine engagement patterns, write appropriate queries, and generate meaningful insights.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User mentions they have a complex database query that needs optimization. user: "This query is running too slowly on our BigQuery dataset" assistant: "Let me use the data-analyst agent to examine your query performance and suggest optimizations" <commentary>Since this involves SQL query optimization and BigQuery operations, the data-analyst agent should be used to analyze the query structure and recommend performance improvements.</commentary></example>
